# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Profile

I'm a **Member of Technical Staff** at **PayPal** with **12+ years of deep expertise** in building high-performance, enterprise-scale systems in the Retail domain.   I'm obsessed with **squeezing every ounce of performance** out of systems, optimizing JVM behavior, and translating complex business chaos into elegant technical architectures.  I'm equally passionate about **building observability into everything** — because you can't optimize what you can't measure.  

Beyond code, I'm a **Toastmasters leader and public speaker** — I've served as President and Vice President of Education, helping others find their voice and impact through effective communication.
